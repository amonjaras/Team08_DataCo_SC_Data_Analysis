# Technologies Used

## Data Cleaning and Analysis
We will use Pandas, Excel and Jupyter Notebook to clean and sort our data and use Python to further explore our data.

## Database Storage
We intend to use Postgres SQL to create our database and house the data on AWS so all group members will have access to the database.

## Machine Learning
SciKitLearn is the ML library we'll be using to create a supervised classification machine learning  model. 
Our training and testing setup will be used to verify precision and sensitivity, and we will use the summary statistics output 
to determine the most accurate model to use.

## Dashboard
Tableau will be used as our visualization tool to create an interactive dashboard to tell the story of the data.  Graphs and plots from Plotly and 
SciKitLearn may also be used in the analysis process.
