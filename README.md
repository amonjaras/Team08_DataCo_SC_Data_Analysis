# **DataCo Supply Chain Data Analysis**
UofT Team 8 Final Project

## **Group Members**

| Member | Role | Responsibilities |
| :----: | :----: | :----: |
| Audrey MONJARAS | Square Role | Will be responsible for setting up the repository, including naming and adding team members. |
| Brent NEWMAN | X Role | Will focus on the technology side of the project. |
| Anureet VIRDI | Circle Role | In charge of the mockup database. Using a SQL-based database, including an ERD of the database and a document pointing out how it is integrated into the database and how it works with the code. |
| Brandon-Scott WILLIAMS | Triangle Role | Responsible for creating a simple machine learning model |

All members will work together on each stage of the project.

## **Phase 1: Sketch It Out**

### **Selected Topic: Supply Chain disruption**

#### **Overview**

Since supply change disruptions have a negative impact on a global production and positive impact on inflation. For this reason, our project will consist on determine whether a delivery will be late and the impact that has on the shipments.

### **Questions we would like to answer**

- How to predict the supply chain disruptions?

- What type of features are impacting those disruptions?

### **Technologies and Tools**
Our proposal for tools are as follows:

| Technologies | Languages | Tools |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| ![pgadmin](https://github.com/amonjaras/Team08_DataCo_SC_Data_Analysis/blob/main/Images/pgadminlogo.png) | ![python](https://github.com/amonjaras/Team08_DataCo_SC_Data_Analysis/blob/main/Images/pythonlogo.png) | ![jupyter](https://github.com/amonjaras/Team08_DataCo_SC_Data_Analysis/blob/main/Images/jupyterlogo.png) |
| ![tableau](https://github.com/amonjaras/Team08_DataCo_SC_Data_Analysis/blob/main/Images/tableaulogo.png) |

##### **Data Cleaning and Analysis**
We will use Pandas and Jupyter Notebook to clean and sort our data and use Python to further explore our data.

##### **Database Storage**
We intend to use Postgres to create our database and house the data on AWS so all group members will have access to the database.

##### **Machine Learning**
SciKitLearn is the ML library we'll be using to create a supervised machine learning regression model.
Our training and testing setup will be used to verify precision and sensitivity, and we will use the summary statistics output
to determine the most accurate model to use.

##### **Dashboard**
Tableau will be used as our visualization tool to create an interactive dashboard to tell the story of the data.  Graphs and plots from Plotly and
SciKitLearn may also be used in the analysis process.
